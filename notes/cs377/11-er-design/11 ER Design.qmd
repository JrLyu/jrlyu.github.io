## Introduction to Database Design
- Conceptualizing the real-world
  - DB design begins with a boss or client who wants a database :)
  - We must map the *entities* and *relationships* in the real world to the concepts of a database. This is called **modeling**. 
  - Sketching the key components is an efficient way to develop a design.
    - Sketch out (and debug) **schema** designs;
    - Express as many **constraints** as possible;
    - Convert to **relational DB** once the client is happy.\

## The Entity/Relationship (E/R) Model
- Overview:
  - Using the E/R model to model the real world.
  - From there, designing a database schema:
    - Reconstructuring of an E/R model
    - Translating an E/R model into a logical model (DB schema)
  - E/R model is a Visual data model (diagram-based):
    - Quickly "chart out" a databse design
    - Easier to "see" big picture
    - Comparable to class diagrams in UML
  - Basic concept: **entities** and their **relationships** along with **attributes** describing them. 

:::{#nte-entity-set .callout-note}
## Entity Set: (Represented by a rectangle $\Huge{\boxed{\ \ }}$)
- An ***entity set*** represents a category of objects that have properties in common and an autonomous existence.
  - E.g., City, Department, Employee, Sale
- An ***entity*** is an instance of an entity set.
  - E.g., "San Francisco" is an entity in the City entity set.
:::

:::{#nte-relationship-set .callout-note}
## Relationship Sets: (Represented by a diamond $\Huge{\diamond}$)
- A ***relationship set*** is an association between two or more entity sets.
  - E.g., Residence is an relationship set between entity sets City and Employee.
- A ***relationship*** is an instance of a n-ary relationship set.
  - E.g., the pairt ("San Francisco", "John") is an instance of relationship Residence.
:::

- Recursive Relationships
  - ***Recursive relationsihps*** relate an entity to itself.
  - Note, sometimes, relationship is not symmetric. 
    - In this case, we need to indicate the two **roles** that the entity plas in the relationship.
    - E.g., "Sovereign" is a recurvie relationship of "Succession." However, the two rols are "Predecessor" and "Successor".
- Ternary Relationships
  - ***Ternary relationships*** relate three entity sets.
  - E.g., "Supply" is a ternary relationship between "Supplier", "Product", and "Department."

:::{#nte-attribute .callout-note}
## Attributes: (Represented by an oval $\Huge{\circ}$)
- An ***attribute*** describes elementary properties of entities or relationships. 
  - E.g., "Name" is an attribute of the entity set "City."
- Attributes may be single-valued or multi-valued. 
- ***Composite attributes*** are grouped attributes of the same entity or relationship that have closed connected meaning or uses. 
  - E.g., "Address" is a composite attribute of the entity set "City." "Address" can be further decomposed into "Street," "City," "State," and "Zip."
:::

:::{#nte-cardinality .callout-note}
## Cardinalities
- Each entity set participates in a relationship set with a minimum (`min`) and a maximum (`max`) cardinality.
- Cardinalities *constrain* how entity instances participate in relationship instances. 
- Graphically, cardinalities are represented by lines connecting entities to relationships.
```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    A[Employee]---|"(1,5)"|B{Assignment}---|"(0, 50)"|C[Task]
```

  - *Note*: an entity might not participate in any relationship.
- In principle, cardinalities are pairs of non-negative integers $(n,N)$ such that $n\leq N$, where $N$ means any number. 
- Minimum cardinality $n$:
  - If $0$, entity participation in a relationship is **optional**.
  - If $1$, entity participation in a relationship is **rmandatory**.
- Maximum cardinality $N$:
  - If $1$, each instance of the entity is associated with *at most one instance* of the relationship.
  - If $N$, each instance of the entity is associated with *many instances* of the relationship.
:::

- Examples of Cardinalities
```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    A[Tourist]---|"(1,N)"|B{Reservation}---|"(0, N)"|C[Voyage]
```

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    A[Order]---|"(0,1)"|B{Sale}---|"(1, 1)"|V[Invoice]
```

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    A[Person]---|"(1,1)"|B{Residence}---|"(0, N)"|C[City]
```


- Multiplicity of Relationships
  - If entities $E_1$ and $E_2$ participate in relationship $R$ with cardinalities $(n_1,N_1)$ and $(n_2,N_2)$, then the multiplicity of $R$ is $N_1$-to-$N_2$ (which is the same as $N_2$-to-$N_1$).
  - Examples:
    - $1$-to-$1$
    - $1$-to-$N$ or $N$-to-$1$
    - $N$-to-$N$
- Cardinalities of Attributes
  - Describe min/max number of **values** an attribute can have.
  - When the cardinality of an attribute is $(1,1)$, it can be omitted (single-valued attributes).
  - The value of an attribute, nmay also be **null** or have **several** values (multi-valued attributes).
```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    A((Surname)) --- B[Person]
    C((License Number)) --- |"(0,1)"| B
    B --- |"(0, N)"| D((CarRegistration#))
```

  - Multi-valued attributes foten represent situations that can be modeled with *additional entities*.
    - E.g., the above model can be transformed into the following model:
```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    A((Surname)) --- B[Person]
    C((License Number)) --- |"(0,1)"| B
    B --- |"(0,N)"| E{Owns}
    E --- |"(1,1)"| D((CarRegistration#))
```

:::{#nte-key .callout-note}
## Keys: (Represented by an underline $\Huge{\underline{\ \ }}$ or $\Huge{\bullet}$)
- ***Keys*** consist of minimal sets of attributes which uniquely identify instances of an entity set.
  - SSN may be a key of Person
  - firstName, middleName, lastName, address may be a key of Person
- In most cases, a key is formed by one or more attributes of the entity itself (***internal key***).
- Sometimes, an entity doesn't have a key among its attributes. This is called a ***weak entity***.
  - Solution: the keys of related entities brought into help with identification (becoming ***foreign keys***).
- A key for a relationship consists of the keys of the entities it relates. 
:::

- Example of Keys
  - Internal, single-attribute
  - internal, multi-attribute
  - weak entity with foreign key

- Example of Schema with Keys

## Challenges in E/R Design: Modeling the "Real World"
- Life is arbitrarily complex
- **Design choices**: should a concept be modeled as an entity, an attribute, or a relationship?
- **Limitations of the E/R Model**: A lot of data semantics can be captured but some cannot.
- Key to successfull model: **parsimony**:
  - As complex as necessary, but no more.
  - Choose to present only ***relevant*** things. 

## From E/R Model to Relationship Database Schema
- Relational Database Design
  - Given a conceptual schema (ER, but could also be other models), generate a logical (relational) schema.
  - It is helpful to divide the design into two steps:
    - **Restructuring (refining) of the E/R schema**, based on criteria for the optimization of the schema
  - **Tranlation into the logical model**, based on the features of the logical model (relational model)

### Restructuring An E/R Model
- Restructuring Overview
  - Input: E/R Schema
  - OUtput: Resturctured (Refined) E/R Schema
- Restructuring includes:
  - Analysis of **redundancies**
  - Chossing **entity** set vs. **attribute**
  - Limiting the use of **weak entity** sets
  - Selection of **keys**
  - Creating entity sets to replace **attributes** with cardinality **greater than one**.
- Example: Redundancies
  - In the followign E/R schema, the attribute `Manf. Address` is redundant.
```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    B(("<u>Part Number</u>")) --- A[Part]
    C((Name)) --- A
    D((Manf. Name)) --- A
    E((Manf. Address)) --- A
```

  - The schema can be restructured as follows:
```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    B(("<u>Part Number</u>")) --- A[Part]
    C((Name)) --- A
    D((Manf. Name)) --- A
    F[Manufacturer] --- H(("<u>Name</u>"))
    A --- |"(1, 1)"| E{"Made By"}
    E --- |"(1, N)"| F
    F --- G((Address))
```

  - However, here's still a redundancy in the schema: we don't need the `Manf. Name` attribute.
```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    B(("<u>Part Number</u>")) --- A[Part]
    C((Name)) --- A
    F[Manufacturer] --- H(("<u>Name</u>"))
    A --- |"(1, 1)"| E{"Made By"}
    E --- |"(1, N)"| F
    F --- G((Address))
```

- Entity Sets vs. Attributes
  - An entity set should satisfy at least one of the following conditions:
    - It is mor than the name of something; it has at least one **non-key attribute**, or
    - It is the **many** in a many-one or many-many relationship.
  - Rules of thumb:
    - A thing in tis own right: entity set
    - A detail about some other thing: attribute
    - A detial correlated among many things: entity set
  - It is to avoid redundancy. 
- Example: domain fact change: A `Part` can have more than one `Manufacturer`.
```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    B(("<u>Part Number</u>")) --- A[Part]
    C((Name)) --- A
    F[Manufacturer] --- H(("<u>Name</u>"))
    A --- |"(1, N)"| E{"Made By"}
    E --- |"(1, N)"| F
    F --- G((Address))
```
  - However, if we add another domain fact change: No manufacturer address: 

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    B(("<u>Part Number</u>")) --- A[Part]
    C((Name)) --- A
    F[Manufacturer] --- H(("<u>Name</u>"))
    A --- |"(1, N)"| E{"Made By"}
    E --- |"(1, N)"| F
```
  
  - `Manufacturer` does not have a **nonkey** attribute anymore...
    - However, it is an "many" in a many-to-many relaionship.
    - So, we cannot convert it to an attribute.
- Example:  What if we start from the following schema?
```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    B(("<u>Part Number</u>")) --- A[Part]
    C((Name)) --- A
    D((Manf. Name)) --- A
    E((Manf. Address)) --- A
```
      
  - We still apply the same domain fact changes: 
    - A `Part` can have more than one `Manufacturer`, and
    - No manufacturer address.
```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    B(("<u>Part Number</u>")) --- A[Part]
    C((Name)) --- A
    D((Manf. Name)) ---|"(1,N)"| A
```
  - It looks good, but we want to avoid multi-value attributes as it is not compatible with relational DBs.
  - So, we convert the multi-value attribute `Manf. Name` to an entity set.
- Another example: if we apply the domain fact change: A `Manufactuere` can have 0 `Part`. Then, 
```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    B(("<u>Part Number</u>")) --- A[Part]
    C((Name)) --- A
    F[Manufacturer] --- H(("<u>Name</u>"))
    A --- |"(1, N)"| E{"Made By"}
    E --- |"(0, N)"| F
    F --- G((Address))
```
    
  - If no parts are associated with a manufacturer, then we lose all information on the manufacturer in this system. 
- When to use **weak entity sets**?
  - The usual reason is that there is no global authority capble of creating unique IDs.
- Don't oversue weak entity sets:
  - Beginner database designers often doubt that anything could be a key by itself:
    - The make all entity sets weak, supported by all other entity sets to which they are linked.
  - It is usually better to create unique IDs
- Selecting a Primary Key
  - Every entity must have a **primary key**.
  - The crteria for this decision are as follows:
    - Attributes with null values cannot form primary keys.
    - One/few attributes is preferable to many attributes.
    - Internal keys preferable to external ones (week entities depend for their existence on other entities).
- Keep Keys Simple: Multi-attribute and/or string keys
  - Waste space (are redundant)
  - Break encapsulation
  - Are brittle (nasty interaction of above two points)
  - Also: computers are good at numbers, not strings.
- Attributes with Cardinality Greater than One
  - The relational model doesn't allow multi-valued attributes. We must convert these to entity sets. 
- Example: Multi-valued Attributes
  - Consider the following schema:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    B(("<u>Part Number</u>")) --- A[Part]
    C((Name)) --- A
    D((Manf. Name)) ---|"(1,N)"| A
```
  - We have to convert it to the following schema (making `Manf. Name` an entity set):
```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    B(("<u>Part Number</u>")) --- A[Part]
    C((Name)) --- A
    F[Manufacturer] --- H(("<u>Name</u>"))
    A --- |"(1, N)"| E{"Made By"}
    E --- |"(1, N)"| F
```

## Translation into the Logical Model
- Overview
  - Input: E/R Schema
  - Output: Relational Schema
  - Starting from an E/R schema, an equivalent relationap schema is constructed. 
    - "***equivalent***:" a schema capble of representing the same information.
    - A good translation should also:
      - not allow **redundancy**
      - not invite unnecessary **null** values
  - Each entity set becomes a relation whose attributes are
    - the attributes of the entity set, and
  - Each relationship becomes a relation whose attributes are
    - the keys of the entity sets that it connects, plus
    - the attributes of the relationship itslef.
  - **There are some exceptional cases here that will come up later.**

### Many-to-Many Relationships
- Example 1
```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    A[Employee] --- |"(0, N)"| B{Participation} --- |"(0, N)"| C[Project]
    D((Surname)) --- A
    E((Salary)) --- A
    F(("<u>Name</u>")) --- A
    G((StartDate)) --- B
    C --- H((Name))
    C --- I((Budget))
    C --- J(("<u>Code</u>"))
```

:::{#tip-many-to-many-1 .callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Answer
- Employee(<u>Number</u>, Surname, Salary)
- Project(<u>Code</u>, Name, Budget)
- Participation(<u>EmployeeNumber</u>, <u>ProjectCode</u>, StartDate)
:::

- Example 2
```{mermaid}
flowchart TB
  A{Composition} --- |"(0, N) Part"| B[Product]
  B --- |"(0, N) Subpart"| A
  C((Quantity)) --- A
  B --- D((Cost))
  B --- E((Name))
  B --- F(("<u>Code</u>"))
```

:::{#tip-many-to-many-2 .callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Answer
- Product(<u>Code</u>, Name, Cost)
- Composition(<u>PartCode</u>, <u>SubpartCode</u>, Quantity)
:::

- Example 3
```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A[Supplier] --- |"(0, N)"| B{Supply} --- |"(1, N)"| C[Product]
  B --- |"(1,N)"| D[Department]
  D --- E(("<u>Name</u>"))
  D --- F((Telephone))
  G(("<u>SupplierID</u>")) --- A
  H(("SupplierName")) --- A
  I((Quantity)) --- B
  C --- J(("<u>Code</u>"))
  C --- K(Type)
```

  - This schema can be translated into the following relational schema:

:::{#tip-many-to-many-3 .callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Answer
- Supplier(<u>SupplierID</u>, SupplierName)
- Product(<u>Code</u>, Type)
- Department(<u>Name</u>, Telephone)
- Supply(<u>SupplierID</u>, <u>ProductCode</u>, <u>DeptName</u>, Quantity)
:::

### One-to-One Relationships
- Example 1: with mandatory participation for one

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A[Player] --- |"(1,1)"| B{Contract} --- |"(1,1)"| C[Team]
  D(("<u>DateOfBirth</u>")) --- A
  E(("<u>SurName</u>")) --- A
  F((Position)) --- A
  G((Salary)) --- B
  C --- H(("<u>Name</u>"))
  C --- I((Town))
  C --- J(TeamColor)
```

:::{#tip-one-to-many-1 .callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Answer
- Player(<u>DateOfBirth</u>, <u>SurName</u>, Position)
- Team(<u>Name</u>, Town, TeamColor)
- ~~Contract(<u>PlayerDateOfBirth</u>, <u>PlayerSurName</u>, <u>Team</u> Salary)~~
  - This line is incorrect because one player can only have one contract with one team. Having a contract with a team is not a unique identifier for a player.
  - For example, this schema allows Messi to sign contracts with Barcelona and Real Madrid at the same time. This is not possible in real life.
- Contract(<u>PlayerDateOfBirth</u>, <u>PlayerSurName</u>, Team, Salary)

### Another correct solution:
- Player(<u>DateOfBirth</u>, <u>SurName</u>, Position, TeamName, Salary)
- Team(<u>Name</u>, Town, TeamColor)
:::

- Example 2: with mandatory participation for both
```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A[Head] --- |"(1,1)"| B{Management} --- |"(1,1)"| C[Department]
  D((Salary)) --- A
  E((Name)) --- A
  F(("<u>Number</u>")) --- A
  G((StartDate)) --- B
  C --- H(("<u>Name</u>"))
  C --- I((Telephone))
  C --- J((Branch))
```

:::{#tip-one-to-many-2 .callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Answer
- Head(<u>Number</u>, Name, Salary, DeptName, StartDate)
- Department(<u>Name</u>, Telephone, Branch)

### Another correct solution:
- Head(<u>Number</u>, Name, Salary, StartDate)
- Department(<u>Name</u>, Telephone, Branch, HeadNumber)
- *Remark*: We included `StartDate` in table `Head` instead of table `Department` because it is more meaningful to associate the date as a dept was managed with the manager (i.e., the head) rather than with the department.
:::

- Example 3: with optional participation for one
```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  A[Employee] --- |"(1,1)"| B{Management} --- |"(1,1)"| C[Department]
  D((Salary)) --- A
  E((Name)) --- A
  F(("<u>Number</u>")) --- A
  G((StartDate)) --- B
  C --- H(("<u>Name</u>"))
  C --- I((Telephone))
  C --- J((Branch))
```

:::{#tip-one-to-many-2 .callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Answer
- Employee(<u>Number</u>, Name, Salary)
- Department(<u>Name</u>, Telephone, Branch, ManagerNumber, StartDate)

### What if both entities had optional participation, i.e., $(0,1)$?
- Employee(<u>Number</u>, Name, Salary)
- Department(<u>Name</u>, Telephone, Branch)
- Management(<u>ManagerNumber</u>, DeptName, StartDate)

### How can we guarantee that a department cannot have more than one manager?
- Declare a `UNIQUE` constraint for attribute `DeptName` in table `Management`.

### Can `DeptName` be a key instead of `ManagerNumber`? 
- Yes, for this schema, choosing either of them to be a key is correct.
:::

- Summary of Types of Relationship
  - Many-to-many: create a new relation with the keys of the entities and the attributes of the relationship.
  - One-to-many:
    - Manditory participation for one: add the key of the entity with mandatory participation to the relation of the entity with optional participation.
    - Manditory participation for both: add the keys of both entities to the relation.
  - One-to-one:
    - Manditory participation for one: add the key of the entity with mandatory participation to the relation of the entity with optional participation.
    - Manditory participation for both: add the keys of both entities to the relation.
    - Optional participation for both: add the keys of both entities to the relation.
- See summaries in slides `20-er-design-part3.pdf`

## Redundancy
- Will the schema be "good"?
  - The process ensure that there is no redundancy.
  - But only with respect to what the E/R diagram represents.
  - The next topic (DB normalization) will help us better analyze the goodness of a schema design. 
- Redundancy is a disadvantage:
  - larger storage requirements (although usually at negligible cost)
  - more work to maintain consistency (updating data with redundant occurences ⭢ all derived data must be updated)
- But it can also introduce an advantage:
  - reduction in the number of accesses necessary to obtain delivered information.
- The decision to maintain or eliminate a redundancy is partly made by comparing the **cose of operations** that involve the redundant info, and the **storage** needed.
  - Performance analysis
  - other issues to consider: data consistency. x
